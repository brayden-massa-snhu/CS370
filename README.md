In this project, I developed a pirate intelligent agent using reinforcement learning and neural networks to navigate a maze and find treasure before a human player. The project utilized initial code that included a maze environment and an experience replay mechanism. My contributions involved creating a deep Q-learning algorithm within a Jupyter Notebook, which used a neural network to guide the agent's decisions. I implemented functions to build the model and train it through a series of game simulations, incorporating logging to track training progress and using batch updates for stability.

This work ties into the broader field of computer science by showcasing the practical application of reinforcement learning in solving complex problems. Computer scientists often break down complex issues into manageable parts and apply algorithms to optimize solutions, as demonstrated in this project. Ethical considerations, such as ensuring fairness and transparency in intelligent systems, are important when developing autonomous agents. Reflecting on this project highlights how reinforcement learning techniques can be applied to real-world scenarios, enhancing my understanding of neural networks and AI.
